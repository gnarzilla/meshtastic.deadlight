## Overview

**deadmesh** transforms LoRa mesh networks into practical Internet gateways. Built on the [proxy.deadlight](https://github.com/gnarzilla/proxy.deadlight) foundation, it adds transparent mesh networking that lets any device on a Meshtastic mesh access standard Internet protocols HTTP/HTTPS, email, DNS, FTP, as if they had normal connectivity.

**What makes this different from other mesh solutions:**
- Standard protocols work unchanged, browse websites, send email, use apps
- Transparent to applications, no special client software needed
- Automatic fragmentation and reassembly for mesh transport
- Full MITM proxy capabilities for traffic inspection and caching
- Works with existing Meshtastic hardware and networks
- Truly off-grid: solar-powered nodes can provide connectivity across kilometers
- Real-time gateway dashboard with SSE streaming, embedded in the binary

Think of it as giving your Meshtastic network the capabilities of a satellite terminal, running on $30 hardware with zero monthly fees.

## Why This Exists

Meshtastic networks are incredible for messaging and telemetry, but they weren't designed for general Internet access. Each protocol (HTTP, SMTP, DNS) would need custom mesh-aware implementations, a chicken-and-egg problem where applications won't add mesh support without users, and users won't adopt mesh without applications.

deadmesh sits in the middle:
1. **Mesh side**: Speaks fluent Meshtastic (protobuf over LoRa serial)
2. **Internet side**: Speaks every protocol your applications already use
3. **Bridges transparently**: Fragments outgoing requests, reassembles incoming responses

**Result**: Your mesh network works with everything — email clients, web browsers, update tools, API services — without modifying a single line of application code.

### Critical Scenarios This Enables

- **Disaster Response**: Coordinate rescue operations when cell towers are down
- **Rural Connectivity**: Share one satellite uplink across dozens of kilometers
- **Censorship Resistance**: Maintain communication during Internet blackouts
- **Off-Grid Networks**: Festival/protest/research networks that disappear when powered off
- **Development Projects**: Bring Internet services to areas with zero infrastructure

## Features

- **Universal Protocol Support**: HTTP/HTTPS, SMTP/IMAP, SOCKS4/5, WebSocket, FTP, if it runs over TCP/IP, it works
- **Transparent TLS Interception**: Inspect and cache HTTPS traffic to minimize mesh bandwidth
- **Intelligent Fragmentation**: Automatically chunks large requests/responses into ~220-byte Meshtastic packets
- **Store-and-Forward**: Delay-tolerant networking handles intermittent mesh connectivity
- **Connection Pooling**: Reuses upstream connections aggressively to reduce LoRa airtime cost
- **Plugin Extensibility**: Compression, caching, rate limiting, custom protocol handlers
- **Hardware Flexibility**: USB serial, Bluetooth, or TCP-connected radios
- **Zero-Config Detection**: Auto-discovers Meshtastic devices on serial ports
- **Embedded Dashboard**: Real-time gateway monitor with SSE streaming, self-contained in the binary, no external assets

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

**Software**:
- Linux (Raspberry Pi, x86 server, or similar)
- GLib 2.0+, OpenSSL 1.1+
- GCC or Clang

**Hardware** (see [Hardware](#hardware) for details):
- Meshtastic-compatible LoRa radio (ESP32-based recommended)
- Gateway node: Raspberry Pi or similar with Internet connection
- Client nodes: any Meshtastic device (phone, handheld, custom)

### Quick Install

1. **Clone and build**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gnarzilla/meshtastic.deadlight.git
   cd meshtastic.deadlight
   make clean && make UI=1
   ```

2. **Install CA certificate** (for HTTPS interception):
   ```bash
   # Generated on first run at ~/.deadmesh/ca/
   sudo cp ~/.deadmesh/ca/ca.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/deadmesh.crt
   sudo update-ca-certificates
   ```

3. **Connect your Meshtastic radio**:
   ```bash
   # Most devices appear as /dev/ttyACM0 or /dev/ttyUSB0
   ls -l /dev/tty*

   # Add yourself to the dialout group (or run as root)
   sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
   ```

4. **Run the gateway**:
   ```bash
   sudo ./bin/deadmesh -c deadmesh.conf
   # or with verbose output:
   sudo ./bin/deadmesh -c deadmesh.conf -v
   ```

5. **Open the dashboard** at `http://localhost:8081` to monitor gateway activity.

6. **Configure mesh clients** to use the gateway's address as their proxy (see [Usage](#usage)).

## Hardware

### Recommended Gateway Setup

**Option 1: Raspberry Pi Gateway** (most versatile)
- Raspberry Pi 4/5 (2GB+ RAM)
- RAK WisBlock Meshtastic Starter Kit or Heltec LoRa 32 V3
- Connection: USB serial or GPIO UART
- Power: 5V/3A supply or 12V solar panel + battery

**Option 2: ESP32-S3 All-in-One** (compact)
- Lilygo T-Deck or T-Watch S3
- 8MB+ PSRAM required
- Built-in LoRa radio and display
- Power: LiPo battery + solar panel

**Option 3: Industrial/Outdoor**
- Heltec Wireless Tracker or Mesh Node T114
- Weatherproof enclosure
- High-gain directional antenna (5-8 dBi)
- Solar panel + LiFePO4 battery for 24/7 operation

### Client Devices

Any Meshtastic-compatible device works:
- **Android/iOS**: Meshtastic app on phone (Bluetooth to radio)
- **Handheld**: RAK WisBlock, Lilygo T-Echo, Heltec LoRa 32
- **Custom**: ESP32 + LoRa module + deadmesh client build

### Radio Configuration

For best Internet gateway performance:
```bash
# In Meshtastic app or CLI
meshtastic --set lora.region US --set lora.modem_preset LONG_FAST
meshtastic --set lora.tx_power 30  # Check local regulations
meshtastic --set lora.hop_limit 3  # Adjust for network size
```

## Dashboard

deadmesh ships with a real-time gateway dashboard embedded directly in the binary — no external files, no dependencies, nothing to serve separately.

**Access**: `http://localhost:8081` (configurable via `plugin.stats.web_port`)

**Features**:
- Live stats: active links, packets relayed, bytes bridged, gateway uptime
- Gateway log stream via SSE (Server-Sent Events) — zero polling
- Mesh links panel showing active protocol connections
- Green RF terminal aesthetic with antenna favicon in browser tab
- Auto-scroll log with toggle

Build with dashboard support:
```bash
make clean && make UI=1
```

The dashboard uses the same green-on-black theme as the project identity. When mesh-layer data (node RSSI, hop counts, LoRa packet stats) is wired to the API, the Mesh Links panel will populate with per-node telemetry.

## Usage

### Basic Configuration

Create `deadmesh.conf` (or let it auto-generate on first run):

```ini
[core]
port = 8080
max_connections = 50
log_level = info

[meshtastic]
enabled = true
serial_port = /dev/ttyACM0
baud_rate = 115200
mesh_node_id = 0x00000000   ; 0 = auto-detect
fragment_size = 220          ; max payload bytes per LoRa packet
ack_timeout = 30000          ; ms — 30s for mesh ACKs
max_retries = 3
hop_limit = 3

[ssl]
enabled = true
ca_cert_file = ~/.deadmesh/ca/ca.crt
ca_key_file = ~/.deadmesh/ca/ca.key

[network]
connection_pool_size = 5        ; reuse connections aggressively
connection_pool_timeout = 600   ; hold idle connections longer
upstream_timeout = 120          ; allow slow mesh responses (seconds)
```

### Client Setup

**On mesh client devices**, configure proxy settings:

```bash
# Linux/Mac
export http_proxy=http://gateway-ip:8080
export https_proxy=http://gateway-ip:8080

# Or point any application at:
# HTTP Proxy: gateway-ip  port 8080
# SOCKS5:     gateway-ip  port 8080
```

**On Android** (Meshtastic app + ProxyDroid):
1. Install ProxyDroid
2. Set proxy host to gateway IP, port 8080
3. Connect Meshtastic app via Bluetooth to your radio

### Testing

```bash
# HTTP through gateway
curl -x http://localhost:8080 http://example.com

# HTTPS (with CA installed)
curl --cacert ~/.deadmesh/ca/ca.crt -x http://localhost:8080 https://example.com

# SOCKS5
curl --socks5 localhost:8080 http://example.com

# Send email via mesh relay
curl -x http://localhost:8080 \
  --mail-from sender@example.com \
  --mail-rcpt recipient@example.com \
  --upload-file message.txt \
  smtp://smtp.gmail.com:587

# SSH over mesh (SOCKS5 proxy)
ssh -o ProxyCommand="nc -X 5 -x localhost:8080 %h %p" user@remote-server
```

## Configuration

### Full Reference

deadmesh auto-generates a fully commented `deadmesh.conf` on first run. Key sections:

**`[core]`** — port, bind address, max connections, log level, worker threads

**`[meshtastic]`** — serial port, baud rate, node ID, channel PSK, fragment size, ACK timeout, retries, hop limit, gateway announcement

**`[ssl]`** — CA cert/key paths, cipher suites, certificate cache

**`[network]`** — connection pool size/timeout, upstream timeout, DNS, keepalive

**`[vpn]`** — optional TUN/TAP gateway for routing entire device traffic through mesh

**`[plugins]`** — enable/disable individual plugins, plugin directory, autoload list

**`[plugin.compressor]`** — compression algorithms, minimum size threshold (strongly recommended over LoRa)

**`[plugin.cache]`** — cache directory, max size, TTL (reduces repeat mesh traffic significantly)

**`[plugin.ratelimiter]`** — priority queuing (SMTP/IMAP/DNS over video/images)

**`[plugin.stats]`** — dashboard port, update interval, history size

### Optimizing for Mesh Performance

**Bandwidth conservation**:
```ini
[plugin.compressor]
enabled = true
min_size = 512
algorithms = gzip,brotli

[plugin.cache]
enabled = true
max_size_mb = 500
ttl_hours = 24
```

**Latency tolerance** (multi-hop paths):
```ini
[meshtastic]
ack_timeout = 60000
max_retries = 5

[network]
upstream_timeout = 300
connection_pool_timeout = 600
```

**Priority shaping**:
```ini
[plugin.ratelimiter]
enabled = true
priority_high = smtp,imap,dns
priority_low = http_video,http_images
```

### Multi-Gateway Setup

For redundancy across a large mesh:
```ini
[meshtastic]
gateway_mode = true
announce_interval = 300
```

Multiple deadmesh gateways on the same channel will announce themselves, allowing clients to route via the nearest available gateway.

## How It Works

                                 └──────┬───────┘
                                        │
                                        ├─> Other mesh nodes
                                        ├─> Offline message store
                                        └─> Satellite uplink (optional)
```

### Packet Flow

**Request (client → Internet)**:
```
HTTP GET request (1500 bytes)
└─> Split into 7 LoRa packets (~220 bytes each)
└─> Each tagged with sequence number + session ID
└─> Sent hop-by-hop through mesh to gateway
└─> Gateway reassembles → proxies to Internet
```

**Response (Internet → client)**:
```
HTTP response (50KB HTML)
└─> Compressed if plugin.compressor enabled (~5-10KB)
└─> Cached if cacheable (saves future airtime)
└─> Fragmented into LoRa packets with flow control
└─> Client reassembles → delivers to application
```

### Protocol Detection

deadmesh auto-detects protocols by inspecting initial bytes — no configuration needed:

| Initial bytes | Protocol | Handler |
|---|---|---|
| `GET / HTTP/1.1` | HTTP | Fragment and forward |
| `CONNECT host:443` | HTTPS tunnel | Optional TLS interception |
| `EHLO` / `HELO` | SMTP | Email relay |
| `A001 NOOP` | IMAP | Mail client support |
| `\x05` | SOCKS5 | Transparent tunneling |
| `\x04` | SOCKS4 | Legacy tunneling |

### Security Model

**Encryption layers**:
1. **LoRa PHY**: AES-256 at the Meshtastic layer (channel PSK)
2. **TLS**: End-to-end between client and final destination
3. **Proxy MITM** (optional): deadmesh terminates TLS for caching/inspection — requires clients to trust the gateway CA

**Trust model**: Gateway holds the root CA. Mesh uses Meshtastic channel encryption. Clients trust the gateway CA by installing `ca.crt`.

**Privacy**: Mesh node IDs are pseudonymous. For operational security in sensitive deployments, rotate node IDs and channel keys regularly, and avoid PII in mesh metadata.

## Real-World Use Cases

### Disaster Response Network

**Scenario**: Earthquake destroys cell infrastructure

**Setup**: Solar-powered deadmesh gateway at field hospital (satellite uplink). Rescue teams carry Meshtastic handhelds (10km range per hop). Coordinate via email, share maps, update databases.

**Result**: Teams stay connected across 50+ km² with zero functioning infrastructure.

### Rural Community Internet

**Scenario**: Village 30km from nearest fiber

**Setup**: One gateway at village center (WiMAX or satellite backhaul). Residents install Meshtastic radios on roofs. Multi-hop mesh covers entire valley.

**Result**: 100+ households share a single Internet connection. Hardware cost ~$50/household, no monthly fees.

### Protest / Festival Network

**Scenario**: Large gathering needs coordination without government-controlled infrastructure

**Setup**: Organizers carry deadmesh gateways with LTE failover. Attendees use Meshtastic app on phones. Network disappears forensically when powered down.

**Result**: Thousands communicate freely. No persistent logs, no fixed infrastructure to seize.

### Journalist in Blackout Zone

**Scenario**: Government shuts down Internet during protests

**Setup**: Journalist has Meshtastic radio + deadmesh on laptop. Connects to gateway run by colleague 15km away (who has connectivity). Files stories via mesh SMTP relay.

**Result**: Censorship bypassed. Reports reach editors despite blackout.

## Performance

### Throughput Expectations

**LoRa physical layer** (LONG_FAST preset):
- Raw bitrate: ~5.5 kbps
- Effective throughput: ~3-4 kbps after protocol overhead
- Latency: 500ms–5s per hop

**Real-world application performance**:
- **Email**: 10-20 messages/minute (text)
- **Web browsing**: 30-60 seconds per page (with caching)
- **DNS**: ~2 seconds per lookup (cache aggressively)
- **API calls**: 5-10 seconds per request
- **File transfer**: ~400 bytes/sec (~1.4 MB/hour)

**Optimization tips**:
- Enable compression — 3-10x improvement for text content
- Enable caching — repeat requests cost zero airtime
- Use image proxies — reduce image sizes before they hit the mesh
- Batch requests — avoid chatty protocols

### Scaling

**Single gateway**: 10-20 concurrent mesh clients comfortably. EU duty cycle regulations (1% airtime) are typically the binding constraint.

**Multi-gateway**: Horizontally scalable. Gateways announce availability; clients route via nearest. Adding gateways directly adds capacity.

**Bottlenecks in order**: LoRa duty cycle → mesh hop count (>4 hops = diminishing returns) → gateway uplink bandwidth.

## Deadlight Ecosystem

deadmesh is one layer of a modular stack:

| Project | Lang | Role |
|---|---|---|
| [proxy.deadlight](https://github.com/gnarzilla/proxy.deadlight) | C | SMTP/SOCKS/HTTP/VPN proxy foundation |
| **deadmesh** (this) | C | LoRa-to-Internet mesh gateway |
| [blog.deadlight](https://deadlight.boo) | JS | <10KB pages, email posting, edge-first |
| [vault.deadlight](https://github.com/gnarzilla/vault.deadlight) | C | Offline credential store, proxy integration |
| [deadlight-bootstrap](https://v1.deadlight.boo) | JS | Cloudflare Workers + D1 framework |

Each component works standalone but the stack is designed to thrive together — blog.deadlight posting over deadmesh via proxy.deadlight with vault.deadlight managing credentials, all running on solar-powered hardware in a field somewhere.

## Legal & Safety

**Radio regulations**: LoRa operates in license-free ISM bands, but transmission power and duty cycle are regulated. Check your local rules (FCC Part 15 in US, ETSI EN 300-220 in EU).

**Encryption export**: This software includes strong cryptography. Check export restrictions before deploying internationally.

**Responsible use**: This tool can bypass censorship and enable communication in emergencies. It can also be misused. Use ethically and legally. The authors are not responsible for misuse.

**Privacy**: Meshtastic mesh networks are pseudonymous, not anonymous. For operational security in high-risk environments: rotate node IDs, use ephemeral channel keys, avoid PII in mesh metadata.
